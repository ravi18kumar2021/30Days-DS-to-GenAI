# üöÄ 30 Days from Data Science to GenAI

Welcome to my journey of **30-Day DS to GenAI Learning Roadmap** üéØ  
This roadmap is designed to help you transition smoothly from a solid foundation in **data science** to the advanced, in-demand world of **Generative AI** ‚Äî in just 30 days!

In this roadmap, I will start from Python, Data Analysis and EDA, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP and end with hands-on GenAI projects using tools like OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit.

## üß† Learning Philosophy

- üìò **Daily Topics**: Each day covers a new concept from DS to GenAI.
- üß™ **Mini Projects**: Hands-on projects to practice and build a portfolio.
- üìù **Interview Questions**: 5 key questions per day for job prep.
- üåê **GitHub Readme Logs**: Write & push my progress daily to make me consistent and helping to build an impressive public portfolio.
