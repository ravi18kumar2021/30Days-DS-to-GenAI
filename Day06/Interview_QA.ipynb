        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Before building any model, EDA is a crucial first step to ensure that the data is clean, meaningful and ready for machine learning. In simple terms, EDA is the process of analyzing and summarizing a dataset to gain insights. It helps in understanding the structure of the data, detecting potential issues like missing values or outliers and uncovering patterns that can guide further modeling.\n",

        "- Identifies relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
        "- Helps prevent the risk of garbage-in and garbage-out modeling.\n",
